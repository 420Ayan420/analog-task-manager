# analog-task-manager
Let's make a Analog task manager inspired that allows us to display the CPU core loads, CPU core temperatures, CPU power consumption, GPU load, GPU temperature, GPU power consumption, and memory usage.

# build instructions

1.  Use visual studio code for python script and Ardiuno IDE for Ardiuno code.
2.  Install libraries using:
